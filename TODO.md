# TODOs
- fix color bias (in strips, but should be in grids)
- scale bugs
  - fix issue with shifting scale in gui causes redraw of pixels at similar z offsets
  - memory needs to be resized, and sizes need to be standardized for scale of > 1
- implement the following renderings
    - NOTE, near ZERO 'y' progression shows a flat unit that looks a LOT like something from cantor dust (distributions...)
    - cylindrical progression
    - spherical representation
        - shell representation (sphere in sphere in sphere perhaps for different models???)
        - may happen naturally however...
    - protein chain building
    - z-chain building
    - standard rendering, but with byte counts incremented for every 'hit' on a 256x256 grid (frequency counter)
    - hilbert curve
        - 2D
        - 3D
- show menu keys for selecting all available colorings
    - same deal...
- move visual 50/50 into the MIDDLE of the screen, starts and ends at the ends, rather than the middle (easier to focus then)
- menu key for file to read from
- BUG, dynamically reassigned targets do not get set??? (we can double check this...)
- outputter
  - implement STDOUT connection (just to stdout, will need to set this up if needed)
  - implement STREAM connection (to resource)
- cli
  - setup loaddatamaps in cli_getstate_fromargs
  - setup colormap in cli_getstate_fromargs
  - add proper error handling for a missing state in cli_verify_state
