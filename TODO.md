# TODOs
- implement 4D cube (4th dimension scales, hyper cube...)
- fix color bias (in strips, but should be in grids)
- scale bugs (do we really want scale though???)
  - fix issue with shifting scale in gui causes redraw of pixels at similar z offsets
  - memory needs to be resized, and sizes need to be standardized for scale of > 1
- implement the following renderings
    - NOTE, near ZERO 'y' progression shows a flat unit that looks a LOT like something from cantor dust (distributions...)
    - cylindrical progression
    - spherical shell progression representation
        - shells in shells, expanding outwards, use the existing one to make it work
    - protein chain building (from before, but without bug)
    - z-chain building (chaining is valid)
    - byte x byte histogram (progression along y/z for each 'hit' in the grid)
    - hilbert curve
        - 2D
        - 3D
- menu key for file to read from
- cli
  - add proper error handling for a missing state in cli_verify_state
